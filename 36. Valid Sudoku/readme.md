# 36. Valid Sudoku

## Problem
- Determine if a Sudoku is valid:
    + Each row must have the numbers 1-9 occuring just once.
    + Each column must have the numbers 1-9 occuring just once.
    + And the numbers 1-9 must occur just once in each of the 9 sub-boxes of the grid.
- The Sudoku board could be partially filled, where empty cells are filled with the character '.'.
- A valid Sudoku board (partially filled) is not necessarily solvable. Only the filled cells need to be validated.
