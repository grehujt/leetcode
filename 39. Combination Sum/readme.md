# 39. Combination Sum

## Problem
- Given a set of candidate numbers (C) and a target number (T),
- find all unique combinations in C where the candidate numbers sums to T.
- The __same__ repeated number may be chosen from C __unlimited__ number of times.
- All numbers (including target) will be positive integers.
- The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

> For example, given candidate set [2, 3, 6, 7] and target 7,
> 
> A solution set is: 
> 
> [
> 
>   [7],
>   
>   [2, 2, 3]
>   
> ]
