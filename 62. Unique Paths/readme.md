# 62. Unique Paths

## Problem
- A robot is located at the top-left corner of a m x n grid.
- The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. 
- The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid.
- How many possible unique paths are there?

## Solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def uniquePaths(self, m, n):
        """
        :type m: int
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
```
