# 75. Sort Colors

## Problem
- Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.
- Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.
- You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.
- an one-pass algorithm using only constant space.

## Solution
```python
class Solution(object):
    def sortColors(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
```
