## 1. Two sum

> Given an array of integers, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
>
> You may assume that each input would have **exactly** one solution.
> 
> **example:**
> '''
> Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
> 
> Because nums[**0**] + nums[**1**] = 2 + 7 = 9,
> 
> return **[0, 1]**.
> '''

INFO: please use **zero-based** indices.

> tips:
> * combination from itertools might be appealing to you, but indexOf has implicit loop
